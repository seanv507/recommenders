# Recommender Systems

Need to distinguish between explicit rating and implict models.

For explicit models, typically consider recovering matrix only at rated elements.
For implicit models, following Hu, consider imputing empty elements with 0 and adding weighting fro reconstruction error.


###SVD properties
SVD is minimum matrix 2 norm (Frobenius) of reduced rank matrix.
(also can be seen from PCA viewpoint)


# Modelling

What does the matrix represent? what similarity do we use etc?
eg like/not like or play counts or ... 

##Questions
1. How do we 

Matrix factorisation seems based on SVD, so seems
1. recovering covariances 
2.



##Performance metrics?
